# The feeds section contains a list of feeds that should be checked
# Currently only feeds parsable by feedparser are importable, this will probably extended by ics files
# type must be "feed"
# tags are used in hiveminder. currently todo_federator uses the combination of tags and titles to match todos with feed entries
